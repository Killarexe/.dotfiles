This Block Wizard for Minecraft Bedrock Edition let's you add your own custom blocks to the game without any prior coding knowledge.

Select from a list of presets, and customize basic properties of the block.

Then you can use Blockbench's powerful editor to design your own model!

The generated Add-On can be added to Minecraft, and you can use your block to build in your own world!

> Developed by the creator of Blockbench, in collaboration with Mojang Studios!
