This Item Wizard for Minecraft Bedrock Edition let's you add your own custom item to the game without any prior coding knowledge.

Select from a list of presets, and customize properties and functionality of the item.

You can use Blockbench's powerful editor to design a 3D model for your item! And you can design the 2D icon using Blockbench's built-in pixel art editor.

The generated Add-On can be added to Minecraft, and you can use your custom items in your own world!

> Developed by the creator of Blockbench, in collaboration with Mojang Studios!
